This program provides a secure way to record, search, edit, add, or delete password and username information for any number of applications.

In todays internet age, we are required to hold multiple passwords and usernames.  Some people hold as much as 50 usernames and passwords,
each for a different application.  With all of these applications, maintaining unique and memorable passwords becomes increasingly difficult.
Some people resort to using the same password and username for multiple applications.  This practice sacrifices security.

This program will aim to solve the problem.  We will design a program the allows the user to create a unique and secure password for every
application.  The program will provide a means to securely record, search, edit, add, or delete password and username information for any number 
of applications.
